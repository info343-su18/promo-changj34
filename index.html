                        <p><abbr title="Washington Gaming Association">WGA</abbr> Overwatch is a registered student organization
                        under the University of Washington, Seattle and is sponsored by <a href="https://tespa.org/">Tespa Esports</a>.
                        As a student gaming association, we strive to connect students from various backgrounds and communities with
                        one common interest, Overwatch. Even though we are all connected by Overwatch, we are still a group of friends
                        that go out and play other games together. Occasionally we even play games such as Osu! and Minecraft! We are
                        always looking to make more friends!</p>
                        <h2 tabindex="4">What is Overwatch?</h2>
                        <p>Overwatch is team-based multiplayer first-person shooter game that was developed and published
                        by <a href="https://www.blizzard.com/en-us/">Blizzard Entertainment</a>. In the game, players are
                        organized into two teams of six and each player selects a character from a roster of "heroes" to
                        play as. Teams are to work together to secure or defend control points or escort a payload across
                        the map. Join up with your friends and play for fun or test your skills against other players in
                        the competitive mode.</p>
